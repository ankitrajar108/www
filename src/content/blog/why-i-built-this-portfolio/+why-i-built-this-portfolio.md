i’ve always believed that every developer needs a place that truly feels like their own corner of the internet. not a template on social media, not a random linktree something i built myself, the way i wanted.

this portfolio is my space to experiment, share ideas, document things i learn, and build tools that other people might find useful.

here’s what i wanted this site to be:

## a place to show projects
i build tools and websites. having one central place makes it easy for people to explore my work.

## a place to write
i don’t write often, but when i do, i want it to live somewhere i control. this blog gives me a simple spot to drop ideas, explanations, and anything i learn.

## a place to grow
the web changes every day. this site will grow with me more posts, more projects, cleaner design, better ideas.

if you're reading this, thanks for stopping by.
if you want to build your own site, start small and improve as you go. you learn more by shipping than by waiting for perfect.
